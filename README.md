# workforce-burnout-analytics

📊 Workforce Burnout Analytics using Python & SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing workforce burnout and productivity patterns using Python and SQL.
The main objective was to strengthen data analysis skills in Python and improve SQL querying ability by answering real-world, business-driven questions.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow, starting from data preparation to insight generation.

🎯 Problem Statement

Employee burnout often goes unnoticed until it affects productivity or leads to attrition.
Organizations need a data-driven approach to identify burnout risk early using operational data such as working hours, overtime, and leave usage.

This project aims to:

Identify employees at burnout risk

Analyze workload stress across departments

Understand the impact of overtime on performance

📂 Dataset Description

A realistic workforce dataset was created and structured with information such as:

Employee details

Working hours and overtime days

Leave usage

Performance scores

The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and enriched using Python before analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

SQL (MySQL)

Google Colab (for Python analysis)

MySQL Workbench

🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Business Logic Implementation

SQL Aggregations & Analytical Queries

Data-driven Problem Solving

🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

What percentage of employees are at high burnout risk?

How is burnout risk distributed across departments?

How does overtime impact employee performance?

Which employees require immediate workload attention?

🔄 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation (Python)

Removed duplicates and validated data types

Converted date and time fields

Calculated working hours

Created overtime indicators

2️⃣ Feature Engineering

Aggregated employee-level metrics

Classified burnout risk using business rules

Created multiple derived analytical columns

3️⃣ SQL Analysis

Answered business-oriented queries

Performed department-wise analysis

Analyzed overtime vs performance trends

📈 Key Insights

24% of employees were identified as high burnout risk

Certain departments showed higher workload stress

Overtime showed short-term performance gains, indicating potential long-term burnout risk

High-risk employees were identified for targeted intervention
